# Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!

Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

Daylight and everything. __Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!__ *And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go.* The toilet.

## I'm Santa Claus!

You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Bender, quit destroying the universe! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.

1. Shut up and take my money!
2. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!
3. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!

### There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!

And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! We're also Santa Claus! I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.

* Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?
* Ask her how her day was.
* There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!

Soothe us with sweet lies. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!

If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Bite my shiny metal ass. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.

I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? And I'm his friend Jesus. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!

You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

Is that a cooking show? Ummm…to eBay? For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.

I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.

Okay, I like a challenge. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.

Professor, make a woman out of me. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.

Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. Then we'll go with that data file! Throw her in the brig.

No! The cat shelter's on to me. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.

I can explain. It's very valuable. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.
